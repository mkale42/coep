Here $x=$$950$$m$ and $y=$$50$$m$.
There are two possible ways in which School, Playground, Theatre can be arranged.
Arrangement 1:-
School---$950$$m$--->Playground---$50$$m$--->Theatre
Arrangement 2:-
School-----$950$$m$----->Playground
Theatre<---$50$$m$---Playground
Distance between School and Theatre $= $$950$$-$$50$$ = $$900$$m$    ...([distance between School & Playground] $-$ [distance between Playground & Theatre])
School----$900$$m$---->Theatre----$50$$m$---->Playground
