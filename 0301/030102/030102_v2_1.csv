====================Question====================
 <br> If two expressions are $24 - 8$ and $12 + 4$, will they form equation",True,,,,False,,,60,3,,," 
====================Solution====================<br>
            
To check equality of expressions we will check if both of them give same result or not
 <br>First expression $24 - 8 = 16$
 <br>Second expression $12 + 4 = 16$
<br>Since both expression give same values i.e. $16$, answer is True",

 <br> If two expressions are $3 * 3$ and $17 - 8$, will they form equation",True,,,,False,,,60,3,,," 
====================Solution====================<br>
            
To check equality of expressions we will check if both of them give same result or not
 <br>First expression $3 * 3 = 9$

====================Solution====================<br>
            
To check equality of expressions we will check if both of them give same result or not
 <br>First expression $4 - 9 = -5$
 <br>Second expression $10 * 9 = 90$
<br>Since both expressions give different values, the answer is False",
