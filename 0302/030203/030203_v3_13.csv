    <br/>Here is the correct detailed solution
    <br/>Let's suppose the total number of containers to be $X$
    <br/>We know that total containers = containers given + containers left with her
    <br/>That is, $X$ = containers  given + containers left
    <br/>$X$ = $15$ + $17$
    <br/>Hence, the total number of containers = $32$
    <br/>As we know that one container contains $171$ gm of cake, 
    <br/>Therefore, $32$ will contain $32$*$171$
    <Hence, the total number of containers is $32$ and total weight of cake is $5472$ grams",
