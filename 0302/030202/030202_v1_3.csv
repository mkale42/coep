text,text,030202,v1,Let Reema have '$x$' litres of juice. Reema fills juice in $13$ bottles of $10$ litre volume. Select correct operation to solve for '$x$'. ,$ ( x \div 13 ) \times 13 = 10 \times 13 $,,,,$ ( x + 13 ) + 13 = 10 + 13 $,$ ( x + 13 ) - 13 = 10 - 13 $,$ ( x + 13 ) - 13 = 10 - 13 $,60,3,,2019suraj.moolya@ves.ac.in,"
        Reema had $'x'$ litres of juice which will fill<br>  into $13$ bottles of $10$ litre volume.
       <br>  We want to find '$x$'
        
        <br> Therefore we write ,
        <br> $( x \div 13 )  =  10 $
        <br> $( x \div 13 ) \times 13 = 10 \times 13$   ,by multiplying $13$ on both sides ",
